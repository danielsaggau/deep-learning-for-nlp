Luckily for us, T5 has already been trained on SQUAD, which is a similar task, but with the context consisting of snippets from Wikipedia articles. This means that we just need to bring our dataset into the right format, and then we can already take a look at how well T5 performs on it. After that, we will finetune on tweet_qa to improve performance (domain adaptation)."
